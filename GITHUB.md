Main is the code that functions properly. When a module is completed and fully working, it is merged with main
# To Create a New Module
1. Create a fork / branch with the name **MODULE-add**
2. Create a Draft PR for that Module that uses the **MODULE-add** branch
3. When working on that module, commit the change to **MODULE-add**
4. Once the module is finished, go over the commits in the PR
5. If looking good, merge with **master**. 
6. Do approiate things in the Manual Project
7. Create the next module's Draft PR.

# How to edit an existing module
1. Create a fork / branch with the name **MODULE-change**
2. Any changes to existing modules go to the **MODULE-change** group
3. Once a change has been made, commit the change to **MODULE-change**
4. At some point, create a PR of **MODULE-change** *(Maybe use a version number, IDK)*
5. Verify, and merge with Main. 

# How to edit non-module stuff
1. Create a branch with any name, I dont care
2. Commit any changes to **that branch you made**
3. PR, merge w/ **main**, it doesn't really matter yet.
